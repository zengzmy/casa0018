# DL4SN Assessment Submission Guidelines

This folder contains an outline of the content we want you to submit for your final assessment. It should have 2 main parts:

- a report folder containing a report in Markdown written using the template provided
- a projects folder showing the various projects and experiments you have built during the module

The assessment on this module has 3 component parts: 
1. the physical project build (what and how the device senses, choice of approach, quality of data) 
2. the project presentation (narrative, critical analysis and synthesis of learning, clarity of presentation)
3. the project documentation (context, results, reflection)

This repository acts as the basis for documenting all three of those deliverables but mostly the third item in the list.

## Report Folder
The template provides the structure of the information we want you to capture to describe your project. We want you to complete this report in Markdown to get into the habit of documenting your work on GitHub. 

When the report is finished you should export to PDF using an extension of your choice - for example in VSCode we use the handy MarkdownPDF extension. When the PDF has been created, upload that to Moodle for assessment.

## Projects Folder
Your 'Final Project' is the one that you will present at the end of the module and your repository for the project should contain all code and assets used. It is important to document these resources so that other people can understand what is in your repository and replicate your project. 

Whilst the main folder in Projects will be 'Final Project' we encourage you to add in other folders in the space to store any other experimentation you have done during the module - for example, projects from the tutorials.
